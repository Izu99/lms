   - Students: Read-only access to content
   - Teachers: Full CRUD for their content
   - Paper Managers: CRUD for papers only
   - Video Managers: CRUD for videos only

4. **Nested Routes**: Some pages have nested structures:

   - `/student/papers/structure-essay/[id]` - Structure/essay type papers

5. **Meeting Pages**: Both students and teachers have meeting pages for video conferencing
